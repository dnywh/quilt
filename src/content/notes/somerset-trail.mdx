Very nice, varied terrain over 13 km return. Took us just under three hours start-to-finish including a lunch break.

Somerset Lookout was the obvious spot for lunch and it did not disappoint. Good views out west, over the Great Dividing Range and Lake Wivenhoe. The rest of the walk goes quick from here.
