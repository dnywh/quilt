A beautiful walk through subtropical rainforest connecting two stunning locations in the Sunshine Coast hinterland.

The track follows Obi Obi Creek, passing through dense rainforest with towering strangler figs and piccabeen palms. Keep an ear out for the distinctive call of the Wompoo Fruit Dove — its deep "wollop-a-woo" echoes through the canopy.

The highlight is Kondalilla Falls itself: an 80-metre drop into a rock pool surrounded by ferns and moss-covered boulders.
