One of the nicest walks I've done on the Sunshine Coast.

Lots of parking at Baroon Pocket Dam. Looks like a good swimming area too if you can't be bothered walking far.

I saw what was probably a [small-eyed snake](https://australian.museum/learn/animals/reptiles/small-eyed-snake/), and some other walkers told me they saw a red-bellied black snake nearby. Pretty sure there was a platypus in the creek as I swam, too.

Check out the [Wompoo Fruit Dove](https://australian.museum/learn/animals/birds/wompoo-fruit-dove/) I heard:

I swam a few hundred metres north of Flat Rock. [This spot](https://w3w.co/stowing.inks.importing) also looked nice.

Kondalilla Falls itself was super busy. Didn't even see it properly. Too close to another carpark, too many people.

Still, a solid walk.
