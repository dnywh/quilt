Easily the nicest walk I've done on the Sunshine Coast, though you need to pass several river crossings with a 4WD to get there.

Park at the Charlie Moreland day-use area, then follow the Conondale Range Great Walk track. This takes you via the gold mine and Artist's Cascades. Definitely go for a swim at Artist's Cascades, since it's quieter than Boolounba Falls.
