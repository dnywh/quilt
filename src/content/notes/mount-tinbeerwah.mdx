The out-and-back summit walk is (as far as I can tell) completely separate from any other walking track in Tewantin National Park. It's 500 metres from a carpark so fairly busy.
The summit itself is scenic but slightly ruined by fencing along the perimeter.

Surrounding bushtracks aren't connected to the summit walk, so I drove a few minutes down the hill to get some proper steps in.
Starting at Tinbeerwah Road and working my way around clockwise, I went north to McKinnon Drive, east along McKinnon Drive Singletrack, and then back around via Harry's shortcut.

Good in a pinch, though I wouldn't go back there in a hurry.
Here are those two walks in the one map:
