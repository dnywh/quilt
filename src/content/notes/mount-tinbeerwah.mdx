This out-and-back summit walk is completely separate from any other walking track in Tewantin National Park. It's 500 metres from a carpark, so gets fairly busy.
The summit itself is scenic but slightly ruined by fencing along the perimeter and aforementioned foot traffic.

I drove a few minutes down the hill to hit the nearest walkable bushtracks.
Starting at Tinbeerwah Road and working my way around clockwise, I walked north to McKinnon Drive, east along McKinnon Drive Singletrack, and then back around via Harry's shortcut.

Good in a pinch, though I wouldn't go back there in a hurry.

Here are those two walks in the one map:

The entire southern section of Tewantin National Park (bar the 1km Palm Grove walk) is for mountain bikes. Ignore AllTrails and other internet slop that says otherwise.
