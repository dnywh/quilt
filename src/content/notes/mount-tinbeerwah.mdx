I was hoping this would be a trudge through the creek finished off with a vista as the reward. It didn't work out like that.

The out-and-back summit walk is (as far as I can tell) completely separate from any other walking track in this part of Tewantin National Park. It's also 500 metres from a carpark (inclusve of coach parking) so it was busy.
The summit itself is scenic but slightly ruined by fencing along the perimeter.

I drove a few minutes down the hill to get those proper steps in. The summit and surrounding bushtrack aren't connected, as far as I could tell.

Starting at Tinbeerwah Road and walking clockwise, I went north to McKinnon Drive, east along McKinnon Drive Singletrack, and then back around via Harry's shortcut.

Okay in a pinch. Crossing the Cooroibah Creek was nice, though I wouldn't go out of my way to do it again. I somehow ended up on bike path despite my best efforts to avoid them.
