I was hoping this would be a trudge through the creek finished off with a vista as the reward. It didn't work out like that.

The out-and-back summit walk is (as far as I can tell) completely separate from any other walking track in this part of Tewantin National Park. It's also 500 metres from a carpark (inclusve of coach parking) so it was busy.
The summit itself is scenic but slightly ruined by the fencing everywhere.

I drove a few minutes down the hill to get those proper K's in. It seems like the summit and surrounding bushtrack aren't connected.

Starting at Tinbeerwah Road and walking clockwise, I walked north to McKinnon Drive, east along McKinnon Drive Singletrack, and then back around via Harry's shortcut.

Was okay in a pinch. Wouldn't go out of my way to do it again. Somehow ended up on bike path despite my best efforts to avoid them.

Cooroibah Creek was nice.

All of that put together:
