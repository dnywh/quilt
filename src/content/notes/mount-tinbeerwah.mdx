Had some time around Noosa today, so checked out Mount Tinbeerwah. The out-and-back summit hike:

The summit is scenic but visually ruined by the fencing everywhere. The carpark is about 500 metres away. Great for accessibility but the downside is lots of people.

There was also coach parking. Never a good sign for a scenic tranquil spot.

I drove down the hill to do a proper few ks. I didn't see a way to walk to/from the summit aside from the road. I don't think they're connected.

Parked a few minutes down on Tinbeerwah Road and walked clockwise. North to McKinnon Drive, east along McKinnon Drive Singletrack, and then back around via Harry's shortcut.

Was okay in a pinch. Wouldn't go out of my way to do it again. Cooroibah Creek was nice.

Despite my best efforts I ended up on a bike path, or at least there were cyclists on the path.

Good on them but a bit of a shame that Tewantin National Park has no solid bushwalk trails.

Put together:
