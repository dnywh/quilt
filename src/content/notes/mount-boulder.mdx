I wanted to do a bushwalk about 45 minutes outside of Sunshine Coast with a chance for a swim afterwards. This one fit the bill. Here are some notes from Sunday:

- This is a made up loop that extends the otherwise out-and-back Mount Boulder trail (3.2km return). Everything after the summit is management or 4WD road.
- Park at Rock Pools day-use area, just off Hill Road. It's 2WD accessible up until this carpark but 4WD shortly thereafter.
- The Mount Boulder trail portion is a proper climb, and the entire loop felt super snake-y. Wear solid shoes for both of these reasons.
- The rock pools were great but also busy.

I'd suggest sticking to just the out-and-back trail unless you unless you especially want to rack up the kilometres. The roads are a bit boring, and the rock pools get busier as the day gets on. Start super early, go for a swim, and then do another bushwalk somewhere else on the way home.

I didn't take many photos. [This blog post](https://nationalparkodyssey.blogspot.com/2014/09/woondum-national-park-qld.html) has some nice ones.

Here's the full loop:
